# Jupyter AI Contrib

Welcome to Jupyter AI Contrib!

The Jupyter AI Contrib organization contains a set of Jupyter extensions that are designed to enable humans and AI to collaborate together.

## Strategy

Our mission is to create modular, extensible building blocks that enable humans and AI to collaborate effectively in Jupyter environments. We focus on developing components that can be composed together to support a wide range of AI-assisted workflows, from code generation and data analysis to interactive learning and research.

To guide our work and ensure a cohesive ecosystem, we follow these guiding principles:

- **Production Ready** ‚Äî We hold a high bar for performance, reliability, and long-term stability. Our components should be robust enough for real-world research, education, and enterprise workloads.
- **Exceptional User Experience** ‚Äî We prioritize thoughtful interaction design, visual polish, and accessibility. Our tools should be intuitive, inclusive, and beautiful, working seamlessly for all users within the Jupyter ecosystem.
- **Composable, Modular Architecture** ‚Äî We design reusable components that fit together cleanly, enabling users and developers to assemble AI workflows that meet their specific needs without monolithic tooling.

While Jupyter AI Contrib was created by leaders in the Jupyter community, it is not currently an [official Jupyter subproject](https://jupyter.org/governance/list_of_subprojects.html). However, we intend for this organization to become an official Jupyter AI subproject over time as we mature our governance, community, and technical foundations.

## Community

We welcome contributors of all backgrounds and skill levels! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, improving documentation, or sharing ideas, your contributions help make AI-assisted Jupyter workflows better for everyone. All community members are expected to follow the [Jupyter Code of Conduct](https://jupyter.org/governance/conduct/code_of_conduct.html).

Please join the community conversation on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/jupyter-ai-contrib/discussions) to ask questions, share ideas, or propose new features.

## Governance

The organization is owned and governed by the following decision makers (in alphabetical order):

- [@ellisonbg](https://github.com/ellisonbg) - Brian Granger
- [@3coins](https://github.com/3coins) - Piyush Jain
- [@dlqqq](https://github.com/dlqqq) - David Qiu
- [@Zsailer](https://github.com/Zsailer) - Zach Sailer
- [@jtpio](https://github.com/jtpio) - Jeremy Tuloup

Jupyter AI Contrib follows a simple, consensus-seeking governance model designed to enable rapid iteration while maintaining quality and community input. We implement this by roughly following the [Jupyter Decision Making Guide](https://jupyter.org/governance/decision_making.html) with the above decision makers guiding the consusus seeking process and voting when needed.

Org-level decisions are made by majority vote of the org owners on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/jupyter-ai-contrib/discussions) using thumbs up üëç and thumbs down üëé reactions. These org-level decisions include new repository creation, promotion of repositories to "Stable" status, new org owners, etc.
